üëÅÔ∏è Projects in Computer Vision including object segmentation, facial recognition &amp; biometric authentication.  

These three discussions explore how each of three algorithms from the <b>OpenCV</b> open-source library can detect and recognize objects & faces.  

Dependencies:
- opencv-python
- scikit-learn
- scikit-image

## ü•∏ Facial Recognition  

We explore Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Histogram of Gradients (HoG), and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithms with examples and sampling refinement explorations using a few of my own photographs. Note that the "Houston" image is the intellectual property of Houston's prolific civic artist [Gonzo247](https://www.gonzo247.com/about-gonzo247) ‚ò∫

## üïµÔ∏è Edge Detection / Shadow & Highlight Detection

We explore Fourier Frequency Transformation (FFT), Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT), Low-Pass Filter Mask (LPF), and the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) techniques.

## ü´Ü Biometric Authentication

Classification of real versus fabricated fingerprints in Computer Vision. We compare performance and accuracy for Histogram of Gradients (HoG) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) classifiers.
